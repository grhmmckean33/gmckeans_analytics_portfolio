# [Project 1 - Power BI Offender Data Dashboard](https://grhmmckean33.github.io/gmckeans_analytics_portfolio/)

# Background
This project focuses on using Power BI to create a dashboard analysing prison ethnographic data for England. This visualisation of data was done during the UK riots of 2024 to investigate the correlation between race, religion and crime. This was done to establish the true nature of the makeup of offenders in light of disinformation and unreliable assumptions from social media sources and sensational media headlines, which suggested ethnic minorities and religions other than Christianity made up the majority of offenders in England and Wales.

Based on this dashboard data I was then able to write an article on Medium, which spelt out previous misconceptions and presented the correct data clearly and accurately.

# Dataset 
The data was taken from the UK Governments 'Office of National Statistics' (ONS), and includes the following:

- Collections of data spanning 2004 - 2023, from the ONS website.
- A Power BI dashboard of the data which gives an easy to understand snapshot of any give year which can be selected by year filter.
- Collections include Total number of offenders as well as a breakdown by Gender, Age, Ethnicity and Religion.
- On the sdashboard there is a Religioius trends line chart, that looks at religious belief of offenders as a comparison between 2004 - 2023.

# Power BI Dashboard
Although I have included a screenshot below of the dashboard, a link to a video demo which will automatically download can be found here - [Prison Data Dash Demo - Short.mp4](https://github.com/grhmmckean33/gmckeans_analytics_portfolio/raw/refs/heads/main/Prison Data Dash Demo - Short.mp4)
Alternatively if you have Power BI installed and you have access to an account that allows you to view power BI files (pbix extension) then you can download the file directly and play with the interctive content here - [Prison Data by Year.pbix](https://github.com/grhmmckean33/gmckeans_analytics_portfolio/raw/refs/heads/main/Prison Data by Year.pbix)
